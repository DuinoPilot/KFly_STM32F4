This is the code for the new KFly PCB.

HW Specs:
* ARM Cortex-M4F STM32F405 CPU w/ FPU and DSP @ 168MHz
* MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyro
* HMC5883L magnetometer
* 8 PWM outputs (50/400Hz)
* 4 expansion connectors (3 UARTs & 1 CAN)
* 6 slot RC input connector with support for (C)PPM up to 8 channels in and signal strength

SW Specs:
* Runs FreeRTOS (with FPU support) with an Hardware Abstraction Layer on top for fast application development
* USB Bootloader
* "Control signal to Motor"-mixing for different types of frames
* Flight control: Rate mode, Attitude mode and more to come

TODO List:
[ ] Finish the bootloader
[ ] Add flash write/save support
[X] Add callback for I2C finished transfer
[ ] Add SPI drivers for external Flash
[ ] Add all comlink parsers
[ ] Make sensor readings interrupt driven
[ ] Finish the HMC5883L and pressure sensor code
[ ] Add interrupts on pin change for sensor data avalible
[ ] Add PWM out for motors
[ ] Add support for all the communication interfaces
[ ] Code the Quaternion based Extenden Kalman Filter
[ ] Code the PI PI - and State Feedback regulator
